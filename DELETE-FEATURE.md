Planned Delete Feature
======================

With the planned `--delete` feature, what I hope to do us list all
users that use the group being deleted as their primary group and
then switch those users to use `nogroup` as their primary group.

When deleting a user, first delete a group of same name as listed
above but non-destructive to any files owned by that user.
