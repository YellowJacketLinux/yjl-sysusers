.SH NAME
yjl\-sysusers\&.json \- static system user UID/GID database
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fByjl\-sysusers\&.json\fR file is a JSON dictionary of system user
and group names which have desired static assignment of User ID (UID)
and Group ID (GID)\&.
.PP
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) was chosen because of both its ease
of use with Python and its ubiquity with programming languages in
general\&.
.PP
The \fByjl\-sysusers\&.json\fR file is used by the
\fByjl\-sysusers (8)\fR
wrapper to
\fBuseradd (8)\fR and
\fBgroupadd (8)\fR
system administration utilities\&.
.PP
In addition to static UID and GID assignments,
\fByjl\-sysusers\&.json\fR also has optional default options to pass
to the
\fBuseradd (8)\fR
command when creating the specified system user account\&.
.PP
Additionally, the
\fByjl\-sysusers\&.json\fR
file may have an entry titled
\fB00\-CONFIG\fR
that configures how the
\fByjl\-sysusers (8)\fR
utility handles dynamically assigned system UID and GID numbers\&.
.PP

.SH FILE LOCATION
.PP
Ordinarily this file should be installed as:
.sp
.RS 8
\fB/var/lib/yjl\-sysusers/yjl\-sysusers\&.json\fR
.RE
.PP
The file is a configuration file but it is also a read-only database
and once installed it should not be modified except by re-installation
of the package that provides it.
.PP

.SH ACCOUNT NAME OBJECTS
.PP
Each system user and/or group account for which a static ID is desired
should have an \fBACCOUNT NAME OBJECT\fR using the \fBACCOUNT NAME\fR
as the index for the object\&.
.PP
The following case sensitive properties of an \fBACCOUNT NAME\fR describe
the \fBACCOUNT\fR:
.PP
\fImyid\fR
.RS 4
Integer\&. Required\&.
.sp
This property is the static UID/GID that should be used, if not already
in use, when creating a user and/or group of the \fBACCOUNT NAME\fR\&.
.sp
The \fBnobody\fR and \fBnogroup\fR entries may share the same \fImyid\fR
values but all other \fBACCOUNT NAME OBJECTS\fR must have a unique
\fImyid\fR value\&.
.sp
The \fBnobody\fR and \fBnogroup\fR entries may have a \fImyid\fR value
of \fI65534\fR but all other \fBACCOUNT NAME OBJECTS\fR must have a
value below \fI1000\fR\&.
.sp
The \fBroot\fR entry must have a \fImyid\fR value of \fI0\fR\&.
.sp
The \fImyid\fB property should not be within the dynamically assigned
system user range identified
by \fISYS_UID_MIN\fR and \fISYS_UID_MAX\fR in the GNU/Linux distribution
default
\fB/etc/login\&.defs\fR configuration file\&. See
\fBman 5 login\&.defs\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIusr\fR
.RS 4
Boolean\&. Recommended\&. Default value is \fIfalse\fR\&.
.sp
This property defines whether the default action of
\fByjl-sysusers (8)\fR
should be to create a user account associated with the
\fBACCOUNT NAME OBJECT\fR\&.
.sp
If the \fIusr\fR property is either not defined or defined to
\fIfalse\fR\ then the \fIgpr\fR property must be defined to
\fItrue\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIgrp\fR
.RS 4
Boolean\&. Recommended\&. Default value is \fIfalse\fR\&.
.sp
This property defines whether the default action of
\fByjl-sysusers (8)\fR
should be to create a group account associated with the
\fBACCOUNT NAME OBJECT\fR\&.
.sp
If the \fIgrp\fR property is either not defined or defined to
\fIfalse\fR\ then the \fIusr\fR property must be defined to
\fItrue\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIgroup\fR
.RS 4
String\&. Optional, rarely appropriate\&.
.sp
When present, this property defines the primary group that
a user of the same name as the \fBACCOUNT NAME OBJECT\fR
should belong to when a group of the same name is not to
br created\&.
.sp
When the \fIgroup\fR property is present, the \fIusr\fR
property must be defined as \fItrue\fR and the \fIgrp\fR
property should either not be defined or defined as
\fIfalse\fR\&.
.sp
When the \fIgroup\fR property is present, the string value
should match the name of another \fBACCOUNT NAME OBJECT\fR
that has a \fIgrp\fR property of \fItrue\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIcomment\fR
.RS 4
String\&. Optional, recommended\&.
.sp
When present, this property defines the default ASCII English
version of the \fICOMMENT\fR
(also called \fIGECOS\fR) field of the /etc/passwd file (see
\fBman 5 passwd\fR) when
\fByjl-sysusers (8)\fR creates a user account using the name
\fBACCOUNT NAME\fR\&.
.sp
When the \fIcomment\fR property is not defined,
\fByjl-sysusers (8)\fR will default to using
"\fBACCOUNT NAME\fR system user account"
as the \fICOMMENT\fR when it creates a user account using the
name \fBACCOUNT NAME\fR\&.
.sp
The \fIcomment\fR property must be printable ASCII of no more
than 60 characters in length and must contain a colon or a
back\-slash\&.
.sp
When translations are available,
\fByjl-sysusers (8)\fR
will use translations of this property as provided by GNU
gettext for systems that uses a non-English default
language\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIhomedir\fR
.RS 4
String\&. Optional\&. Defaults to /dev/null\&.
.sp
When present, this property defines the default
\fIdirectory\fR field of the /etc/passwd file (see
\fBman 5 passwd\fR) when
\fByjl-sysusers (8)\fR creates a user account using the
name \fBACCOUNT NAME\fR\&.
.sp
This is usually called the "home directory" because
it defines the \fIHOME\fR environment variable for the
user account\&.
.sp
The \fByjl-sysusers (8)\fR utility enforces stricter rules
for system accounts, only allowing \fIhomedir\fR values
that are lower case alpha-numeric plus underscore,
forward-slash, and hyphen dashes\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIshell\fR
.RS 4
String\&. Optional, rarely appropriate\&.
.PP
When present, this property defines the default
\fIshell\fR field of the /etc/passwd file (see
\fBman 5 passwd\fR) when
\fByjl-sysusers (8)\fR creates a user account using the
name \fBACCOUNT NAME\fR\&.
.sp
The only valid values for the \fIshell\fR property of a
\fBACCOUNT NAME OBJECT\fR in the
\fByjl-sysusers\&.conf\fR file are
\fI/bin/bash\fR and \fI/bin/sh\fR\&.
.sp
Additional values may be specified to the
\fByjl-sysusers (8)\fR utility as long as the specified shell
is in /etc/shells (see
\fBman 5 shells\fR)\&.
.sp
When the \fBACCOUNT NAME OBJECT\fR does not have a \fIshell\fR
property and a valid \fISHELL\fR option is not passed to the
\fByjl-sysusers (8)\fR utility, the \fByjl-sysusers (8)\fR utility
will use \fB/sbin/nologin\fR (if it exists on the system) or
\fB/bin/false\fR for the \fIshell\fR field of the /etc/passwd file
when it creates a user account of \fBACCOUNT NAME\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fImkdir\fR
.RS 4
Boolean\&. Optional, defaults to \fIfalse\fR\&.
.sp
When this property is set to \fItrue\fR then the default behavior
of \fByjl-sysusers (8)\fR will be to create the home directory
for \fBACCOUNT NAME\fR if the directory does not already exist when
\fByjl-sysusers (8)\fR is asked to create a user account for
\fBACCOUNT NAME\fR\&.
.sp
In most cases, that is not desired for system user accounts because
it will copy the contents of /etc/skel into the created directory\&.
.sp
If the \fImkdir\fR property is either not set or is st to \fIfalse\fR
then the default behavior of \fByjl-sysusers (8)\fR will be to NOT
create the home directory for \fBACCOUNT NAME\fR when it is asked to
add the \fBACCOUNT NAME\fR user\&.

.PP
Obviously the \fBroot\fR user does not need to be mentioned in the
JSON file, that user must exist on the system before the
\fByjl\-sysusers (8)\fR utility can be used, but it is good to have
it for completeness as well as a rather complete example entry\&.

.SH MODIFICATION
I recommend against modifications being applied to an installed
\fByjl\-sysusers\&.json\fR file\&. A JSON mistake will break the
ability of \fByjl-sysusers (8)\fR to function\&.
.PP
It is better to update the JSON in the \fByjl-sysusers\fR source
package and build an updated package, so that the modification will
be validated during package creation\&.
