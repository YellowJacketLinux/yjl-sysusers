yjl-sysusers
============

__VERSION 0.1.5 PRE-RELEASE__

For installation instructions, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)

This project includes a single utility and a JSON file. In the git
source, that utility is simply called `functions.py` but it gets
installed as `/usr/sbin/yjl-sysusers` with a single-line change
to specify the location on the filesystem of the JSON file.

This project is currently being developed using Python 3.11.3 but it
has been tested in Python 3.6.4 (CentOS 7.9.2009) without issues.

The purpose is to provide an easy way to provide consistent static
user ID and group ID numbers for system users (as opposed to human login
users) while also being able to on-the-fly use dynamic IDs if the static
IDs have already been used for something else.

My use case is for RPM `%pre` scriptlets to ensure that the appropriate
users and groups an RPM package needs exist when the package installs.


yjl-sysusers
------------

With the `yjl-sysusers` utility, portable RPM spec files which produce
packages that are installable across multiple LSB compliant GNU/Linux
distributions (sometimes with a rebuild for shared library resolution)
becomes much easier.

Theoretically (not yet implemented or tested) with the `yjl-sysusers`
utility, translations of user comment (also called GECOS) field into
the default system locale will be automatic, when the translation is
available.

See the [yjl-sysusers.8](docs/yjl-sysusers.8.md) man page for usage.


yjl-sysusers.json
-----------------

The `yjl-sysusers.json` file in the top-level directory of the source
tarball is tailored to YellowJacket GNU/Linux.

The `yjl-sysusers.json` file installed by a package manager *should*
be tailored to the distribution the package is built for.

This JSON file includes the distribution-specific static UID/GID
assignments for certain users and groups, as well as distribution-
specific configurations for how to handle things like dynamic UID/GID
allocation.

A network or organization administrator of multiple systemâ€”even different
distributionsâ€”can customize the JSON and rebuild the package to add
specific static allocations that are needed for use cases specific to
that network or organization.

For the file format, see
[yjl-sysusers.json.5](docs/yjl-sysusers.json.5.md) man page.

As long as `yjl-sysusers.json` matches the specification of your
distribution and the requirements of your distribution, you should
be able to install this package and then any RPM package that uses
`yjl-sysusers` to ensure system groups and users exist should do the
right thing on your system.


Validation Failures and Handling
--------------------------------

If the user running the `yjl-sysgroups` utility does not have `root`
privileges, the utility will exit with a failure status.

If the JSON file is malformed, the `yjl-sysgroups` utility will exit
with a failure status. That should never happen unless the JSON file
is improperly modified after install.

If a username or groupname passed as an argument does not validate,
the `yjl-sysusers` utility will exit with a failure status.

If anything other than the case sensitive `True` or `False` is passed
with the `--useradd`, `--groupadd`, or `--mkdir` options, the
`yjl-sysusers` utility will exit with a failure status. I consider
that to be a bug I need to fix.

If there are no available UIDs/GIDs left in the system user dynamic
range when one is needed, the `yjl-sysusers` utility will exit with
a failure status.

Other than those cases, failure of the program should be extremely
rare and considered a bug.

As the intended use is within RPM, it is better for the program to
choose a safe default and continue (such as using `/dev/null` for
the home directory or `/sbin/nologin` as the login shell) if a bad
value is passed to `yjl-sysusers` so that the user is created and
the proper assignment of files belonging to users and groups the
script is asked to create can still be made.


Python Notes
------------

Python 3 is required. A few distributions (like CentOS 7) are still
at present supported that use Python 2 as the distribution Python
interpreter, but AFAIK all of those distributions offer Python 3 as
well.

One feature I know requires Python 3.6+, the script has been tested
in Python 3.6.8 (CentOS 7.9.2009) and it works.

I strive to always have a `pylint` score at or above 9 but even when
at such a score, reported issues should be looked at.

False positives are disables and `global keyword` warnings are disabled,
this utility has a genuine use case for the `global keyword`.

The `pylint` utility reports some code readability warnings about coding
style with respect to the `main()` function that *probably* need to be
dealt with for the sake of readability. It is correct about those. That
function probably needs to be refactored.

The `pylint` utility also reports some `No exception type(s) specified
(bare-except)` warnings.

At least some of those are safe to ignore, but I do not feel comfortable
disabling that warning.


My Arrogant Distribution Packaging Rant
---------------------------------------

By â€˜My Arrogantâ€™, I do mean me.

I literally __HATE__ distribution specific macros and how they have
proliferated in quantity and complexity since the â€˜Good Old Daysâ€™.

Now get off my lawn, ya damn youngsters! Humor aside, it does seem RPM
packaging is losing the KISS ðŸ˜› concept and I think that is bad for
GNU/Linux.

A desktop user should not have to be a packaging guru in order to
successfully rebuild a spec file written for Distribution A on
the userâ€™s Distribution B system. That is incredibly frustrating
and encourages users to just not utilize the package management
system, often leading to future problems and frustrations.

Something as simple and universal as ensuring the proper system users
and groups exist should not, for example, require a
`systemd-rpm-macros` package and the installation of a package-specific
user metadata file that often only have meaning to a specific distribution.

What the frack does SystemD have to do with basic Unâ€¢x user and group
management?

Yes, Fedora, I am talking smack about you. You are no longer the
distribution I loved when Red Hat Linux became Fedora Core.

Most RPM based distributions are guilty of the same thing, clearly
making RPM unsuitable as an LSB-mandated package manager.

I like RPM when used properly, but it is too easy for GNU/Linux
distributions to do the wrong thing and decrease cross-distribution
compatibility.

Some added complexity is sometimes necessary, but SystemD being
required for fundamental user and group management? No. Just No.
