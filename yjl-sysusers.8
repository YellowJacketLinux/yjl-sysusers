.\" ---
.\" --- end Synopsis
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fByjl\-sysusers\fR is a wrapper script to the operating system
\fBgroupadd\fR and \fBuseradd\fR commands that allows respecting
the operating system static UID and GID assignment when available,
without the need to assign them manually\&.
.PP
Static UID and GID values, as well as some other parameters useful to
the \fBuseradd\fR command, are defined in the file
\fByjl\-sysusers\&.json\fR which is normally located in the directory
/var/lib/yjl\-sysusers\&.
.PP
\fByjl\-sysusers\fR was developed with RPM package scriptlets in
mind\&.
.\" ---
.\" --- end Description
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
Options can be used when \fIACCOUNT\fR has not been described
in the \fByjl\-sysusers\&.json\fR file or to override default
settings for \fIACCOUNT\fR as defined in the
\fByjl\-sysusers\&.json\fR file\&.
.PP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
.RS 4
Display help message and exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-comment\fR \&\fICOMMENT\fR
.RS 4
Define the comment field to be used in the /etc/passwd file\&.
This is used to provide a brief description of \fIACCOUNT\fR\&.
\fICOMMENT\fR must be printable ASCII, excluding the \\ and :
characters\&.
\fICOMMENT\fR must not exceed 60 characters\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-home\fR \fIHOME\fR
.RS 4
Define the home directory to be used with the system user account\&.
It must be full path and can only use lower\-case alpha\-numeric
characters plus underscore, forward\-slash, and hyphen\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-shell\fR \fISHELL\fR
.RS 4
Define the login shell to be used with the system user account\&.
If \fISHELL\fR is not present in /etc/shells or is not installed on
the system, then /sbin/nologin or /bin/false will be substituted\&.
.sp
Any argument that is not full-path is invalid, so you can just
use \fInoshell\fR as the \fISHELL\fR arguement to guarantee that
either /sbin/nologin or /bin/false are used as the login shell.
.sp
\fByjl\-sysuers\fR will use /sbin/nologin for any \fIACCOUNT\fR
that does have a valid \fISHELL\fR specified unless /sbin/nologin
is not present on the system\&. In such cases, /bin/false is
used instead\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-useradd\fR \fI{True,False}\fR
.RS 4
Define whether or not the user name \fIACCOUNT\fR should be created\&.
.sp
When \fB\-\-useradd\fR is set to \fIFalse\fR then \fB\-\-groupadd\fR
is automatically set to \fITrue\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-groupadd\fR \fI{True,False}\fR
.RS 4
Define whether or not the group name \fIACCOUNT\fR should be created\fR.
.sp
When \fB\-\-groupadd\fR is set to \fIFalse\fR then \fB\-\-useradd\fR
is automatically set to \fITrue\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-g\fR, \fB\-\-group\fR \fIGROUP\fR
.RS 4
Define the primary group for the user \fIACCOUNT\fR with a different
group name than \fIACCOUNT\fR\&.
.sp
If the group \fIGROUP\fR does not exist, it will be created
automatically\&.
.sp
When \fIGROUP\fR is defined, the group \fIACCOUNT\fR will not be
created regardless of \fB\-\-groupadd\fR and the user \fIACCOUNT\fR
will be created regardless of \fB\-\-useradd\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-mkdir\fR \fI{True,False}\fR
.RS 4
Define whether or not the home directory for user \fIACCOUNT\fR should
be created\&. The default with system accounts is not to create the
directory automatically\&.

.SH USAGE NOTES
.PP
Python 3.9 or newer is needed for \fByjl\-sysusers\fR\&.
.sp
The boolean options (\fB\-\-useradd\fR, \fB\-\-groupadd\fR, and
\fB\-\-mkdir\fR) are case sensitive \fITrue\fR or \fIFalse\fR\&.
.sp
When \fB\-\-groupadd \fIFalse\fR is used without using
\fB\-g\fR, \fB\-\-group\fR \fIGROUP\fR then the system group
\fInogroup\fR
will be used as the primary group for \fIACCOUNT\fR\&.

.SH PACKAGER NOTES
.PP
When creating an RPM (or other) package that has files owned by
non-root users and groups, you should use \fByjl\-sysusers\fR in
the package \fI%pre\fR scriptlet to ensure the appropriate
users and groups exist at the time the files are installed\&.
.sp
RPM packagers should use the macro \fB%{_yjl_sysusers}\fR rather
than the command \fByjl\-sysusers\fR or
\fB/usr/sbin/yjl\-sysusers\fR\&.
.sp
RPM packagers should \fBRequires(pre): %{_yjl_sysusers}\fR\&.
.sp
Packagers should avoid using
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-comment\fR \fICOMMENT\fR as it can interfere
with the string being properly translated via gettext i18n
facilities into the preferred language of the system\&.
.sp
Packagers should usually avoid using
\fB\-\-mkdir\fR \fITrue\fR\&.
.sp
When \fBuseradd\fR creates the \fIHOME\fR directory, it also copies
the contents of /etc/skel into that directory\&. Usually that is not
desired\&. It is often better to have the package create the
\fBhome\fR directory when a home directory is needed\&.
.sp
Packagers should never assume the contents of the
\fByjl-sysusers\&.json\fR file are correct for the package, but
should specify the correct option parameters when ensuring that
\fIACCOUNT\fR exists\&.
.sp
The primary motivation for this wrapper script is to allow for
truly portable RPM spec files that can build and install on many
GNU/Linux distributions while still respecting the static GID/UID
assignments for system users and groups that a distribution (or
system administrator) wants to enforce\&.
.sp
A secondary motive for this wrapper script is to allow for the
internationalization of system user account descriptions (the
\fICOMMENT\fR of /etc/passwd) at the time of package install\&.
.sp
Lazy packaging where the packager relies upon
\fByjl-sysusers\&.json\fR
to have correct user account parameters is not a motive for this
package, although compensating for lazy packaging was a motive for
allowing sane \fBuseradd\fR defaults to be specified in that file\&.

.SH CONFIGURATION
.PP
The default options on a per-\fIACCOUNT\fR basis for accounts with
preferred static UID/GID assignment are in the
\fByjl-sysconfig\&.json\fR
file\&. All options except for the UID/GID can be overriden with
options passed to \fByjl\-sysusers\fR\&.
.PP
The range of dynamically generated UID/GID values is currently
hard-coded within the load_id_list() function\&. A future version
of this program will make that easier to configure\&.
.PP
The current default group name to use for user accounts created
with \fB\-\-groupadd\fR \fIFalse\fR and without
\fB\-g\fR, \fB\-\-group\fR \fIGROUP\fR is currently hard-coded
within the request_gpname_from_json() function\&. A future version
of this program will make that easier to configure\&.

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
\fByjl-sysusers\fR \fB\-\-useradd\fR \fIFalse\fR \fIplocate\fR
.sp
.RS 4
Ensure the \fIplocate\fR group exists, without create a \fIplocate\fR user\&.
.RE
.PP
\fByjl-sysusers\fR
\fB\-g\fR \fImail\fR
\fB\-h\fR \fI/var/lib/sendmail\fR
\fB\-s\fR \fInoshell\fR
\fIsendmail\fR
.sp
.RS 4
Ensure the \fImail\fR group exists. Ensure the \fIsendmail\fR user exists,
creating it if necessary using \fI/var/lib/sendmail\fR as the \fIHOME\fR
directory, using either /sbin/nologin or /bin/false as the login shell\&.
.sp
If the \fIsendmail\fR user does not already exist, it will be created
with \fImail\fR as the primary group it belongs to.
.RE
.PP

\fB\-\-useradd\fR \fITrue\fR \\

.RS 2

\fIsendmail\fR &&
.RE
.br
\fBusermod\fR \fB\-a\fR
\fB\-G\fR \fImail\fR
\fIsendmail\fR
.sp
.RS 4
First ensure that the \fImail\fR group exists\&. Then ensure that the
\fIsendmail\fR user exists as in the previous example, only if the
user is created, it is created with \fIsendmail\fR as the primary
group\&. Finally, add the \fIsendmail\fR user to the \fImail\fR
group\&.
.sp
As a packager, btw, that is my preferred method of dealing with
system users that need to belong to a system group of a different
name.

Yes, I have seen Starship Troopers.
Bugs can be very insideous and hard to get rid of, but I expect them to
be random and light.
