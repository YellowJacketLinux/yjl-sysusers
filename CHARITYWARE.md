This software is ‘Free Libre Open Source Software’ (FLOSS) even
if you are a heartless individual who despises immigrants fleeing
oppression in their homeland, but inspired by [Vim](https://www.vim.org/),
it the request of the author of this software (Michael A. Peters, not
YellowJacket GNU/Linux specifically) that if you can afford to do so,
you make a donation to one or both of the following organizations that
provide much needed help to undocumented immigrants within America.

For those who not within America, you can likely find organizations
within your own country that are similar in nature.

Movimiento Cosecha
------------------

Website: https://www.lahuelga.com/

From their website (see https://www.lahuelga.com/about):

    Cosecha is a nonviolent movement fighting for permanent protection,
    dignity, and respect for the 11 million undocumented immigrants in
    the United States. Our name, "harvest" in Spanish, honors the long
    tradition of farmworker organizing and the present-day pain of the
    thousands of undocumented workers whose labor continues to feed the
    country. Committed to winning real victories for our community,
    Cosecha believes in using non-cooperation to leverage the power of
    immigrant labor and consumption and force a meaningful shift in
    public opinion.

National Immigrant Justice Center
---------------------------------

Website: https://immigrantjustice.org/

From their website (see https://immigrantjustice.org/about-nijc):

    Heartland Alliance’s National Immigrant Justice Center (NIJC) is
    dedicated to ensuring human rights protections and access to justice
    for all immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers.

    With offices in Chicago, Indiana, San Diego, and Washington, D.C.,
    NIJC provides direct legal services to and advocates for these
    populations through policy reform, impact litigation, and public
    education. Since its founding three decades ago, NIJC has been
    unique in blending individual client advocacy with broad-based
    systemic change.

    “I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me
      drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me.”


A Teacher from Tarsus

A Teacher from Babylon

    “Now this was the sin of Sodom. She and her people were arrogant,
      overfed, and lacking in empathy. They would not help the poor or
      those in need.”
